This is my take on the Amazon website as a single page application.

The front end is built using React.

The backend uses Node and is built using Firebase. It is used to process payments using the Stripe API.

Firebase authentication is used to login users. Users will have to create an account and then log in with that username and password.

**If you add items to the cart and decide to checkout, use the following for card info (it is a test card, nothing to worry about. Your payment will still be processed):  
Card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242  
MM/YY: 04 / 24  
CVC: 242  
ZIP: 42424**
